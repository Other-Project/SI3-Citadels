### How to Contribute

#### Create an Issue

Before programming, you need to create an issue with a clear and concise title and description.
There is a list of the important things to do :

* Assign the people who will solve it
* Choose the tags that correspond to the type of the issue
* Select the current project in Projects
* Select the corresponding milestone

#### Issue Lifecycle

When an issue is first created, it is flagged `Todo` waiting for a team
member to do it.

When a fix is ready, the issue is closed and may still be re-opened until the fix is
released. After that the issue will typically no longer be reopened. In rare cases if the
issue was not at all fixed, the issue may be re-opened. In most cases however any
follow-up reports will need to be created as new issues with a fresh description.

#### Submit a Pull Request

1. Always check out the `main` branch and submit pull requests against it.

2. Create a branch of the following form: 'feature/feature_name' and check out it.

3. For all the commit you will make in this branch use
   the [GitHub commit convention](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).
   You must absolutely cite the issue in the commit using `#issue_number`.

4. Do not forget to test your code by adding the necessary methods (or classes)
   in
   the [test folder](https://github.com/pns-si3-projects/projet2-ps-23-24-citadels-2024-c/tree/main/src/test/java/fr/univ_cotedazur/polytech/si3/team_c/citadels).

5. When you have made all the necessary changes you can now push to the branch you created locally and create a pull
   request,
   by indicating all the information about it and filling the fields.

Then the other contributors to the project will provide their feedback on your code, and
they will be able to suggest modifications to improve it. When several contributors have
approved your changes, they can then merge it with the `main` branch.

#### Participate in Reviews

Helping to review pull requests is another great way to contribute. Your feedback
can help to shape the implementation of new features.
